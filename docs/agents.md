## WhatsApp Agent

The WhatsApp agent enables bidirectional communication through your personal WhatsApp account using QR code authentication.

### Requirements
- Go 1.21+ and Git (for WhatsApp backend)
- Python 3.13+
- A configured LLM provider

### Configuration

```bash
# 1. Copy example config
cp agntrick/config/whatsapp.yaml.example agntrick/config/whatsapp.yaml

# 2. Edit config/whatsapp.yaml with your settings:
# - model: "claude-sonnet-4-6"  # Your LLM model
# - privacy.allowed_contact: "+34 666 666 666"  # Your phone number (only this number can interact)
# - channel.storage_path: "~/storage/whatsapp"  # Where to store session data
# - mcp_servers: ["web-fetch", "duckduckgo-search"]  # Optional: MCP servers to use
```

### Usage

```bash
# Start the WhatsApp agent
bin/agntrick.sh whatsapp --config config/whatsapp.yaml

# With custom settings (overrides config file)
bin/agntrick.sh whatsapp --allowed-contact "+1234567890" --storage ~/custom/path

# Customize MCP servers
bin/agntrick.sh whatsapp --mcp-servers "web-fetch,duckduckgo-search"
bin/agntrick.sh whatsapp --mcp-servers none  # Disable MCP

# Verbose mode for debugging
bin/agntrick.sh whatsapp --verbose
```

### First Run
1. Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal
2. Wait for WhatsApp to authenticate
3. Send a message from your configured phone number
4. Agent will respond automatically

### Privacy & Security
- 🔒 Only processes messages from the configured contact
- 🔒 Group chat messages are automatically filtered (not sent to LLM)
- 🔒 All data stored locally (no cloud storage of conversations)
- 🔒 Messages from other contacts are silently ignored
- 🔒 Message deduplication prevents reprocessing

### Configuration Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `model` | LLM model to use (defaults to provider default) |
| `mcp_servers` | MCP servers for web search and content fetching |
| `privacy.allowed_contact` | Only this phone number can interact with the agent |
| `privacy.log_filtered_messages` | Log filtered messages for debugging |
| `channel.storage_path` | Directory for WhatsApp session and database files |
| `features.group_messages` | Currently disabled by default for privacy |

### MCP Servers
- `webfetch` - For fetching web content
- `duckduckgo-search` - For web search capabilities

### Slash Commands

The WhatsApp agent uses a router architecture that responds to special command prefixes, providing different modes of interaction:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/learn <topic>` | **Learning Mode:** Get step-by-step tutorials and detailed explanations. The agent breaks down complex topics into clear, logical steps with practical examples. |
| `<any message>` | **Default Mode:** General assistant with web search and chat capabilities. |

#### Learning Mode (`/learn`)

Use the `/learn` command when you want in-depth tutorials and explanations on any topic:

```
You: /learn how to build a REST API with Python

Agent: *Here's a step-by-step tutorial on building a REST API with Python:*

1. **Choose a Framework** - Flask or FastAPI are popular options
2. **Install Dependencies** - `pip install flask`
3. [continues with detailed steps...]
```

The learning mode is designed for education, providing:
- Structured, step-by-step breakdowns
- Clear explanations of technical terms
- Practical examples and analogies
- Encouraging and patient communication style

#### Default Mode

For quick questions, web searches, or general conversation, just send a message without any command prefix:

```
You: What's the weather like in Madrid?

Agent: I'll check the current weather in Madrid for you...
[uses web search to fetch and summarize current conditions]
```
